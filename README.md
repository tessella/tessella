## About Me

I'm a quantitative researcher and aspiring trader passionate about applying rigorous mathematics and machine learning to financial markets. Currently pursuing an MSc in Mathematics and Finance at Imperial College London (funded by Fundación Ramón Areces scholarship), I combine a First Class Honours degree in Mathematics (85%) with hands-on experience in systematic trading, financial modeling, and software development.

**What drives me**: Personal experience with the 2008 financial crisis shaped my commitment to developing more accurate quantitative models. I'm fascinated by markets at the intersection of mathematics, technology, and real-world impact.

## Current Work

**(WIP) Paper Replication and Extension**: [Transportation Marketplace Rate Forecast Using Signature Transform](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.2025.0251)
- Authors present a novel use of the signature transform in conjunction with a 2-step LASSO regression model
- Regression model used to predict freight marketplace rates for Amazon
- Aim: replicate results and deploy methodology to predict World Container Index for maritime freight rates

**Quantitative Trader & Researcher** @ Team Delta, QTC Alpha Fund (Imperial College)
- Developing systematic trading strategies for US equities and crypto markets under ex-JP Morgan researcher supervision
- Built Python-based mean-reversion strategy using z-score triggers with dynamic position management
- Statistical validation via Monte Carlo permutations on minute-level tick data

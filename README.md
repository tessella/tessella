## About Me

Aspiring quantitative researcher passionate about applying rigorous mathematics and machine learning to financial markets. Currently pursuing an MSc in Mathematics and Finance at Imperial College London (funded by Fundación Ramón Areces scholarship), I combine a First Class Honours degree in Mathematics (85%) with hands-on experience in machine learning, financial modeling, and software development.

**What drives me**: Personal experience with the 2008 financial crisis shaped my commitment to developing more accurate quantitative models. I'm fascinated by markets at the intersection of mathematics, technology, and real-world impact.

## Current Work

**Quantitative Trader & Researcher** @ Team Delta, QTC Alpha Fund (Imperial College)

## Featured Projects

### UK Gas Demand Forecasting II: Signature Transform [(Link)](https://github.com/tessella/gas-forecasting-II)
Physics-aware model adapting the signature transform to capture non-linear thermal dynamics. Replaced standard scaling with global normalization and Level-3 signatures to preserve absolute thermal signals, achieving **5.88% MAPE** (7-day ahead), outperforming the ~10% industry benchmark.

### Paper Replication: Consumer Loans Forecasting [(Link)](https://github.com/tessella/paper-replication-signature-transform)
Replication and extension of [Gu et al.'s (2025)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.2025.0251) Adaptive Two-Step LASSO. Engineered strict local normalization and momentum-based targeting to eliminate lookahead bias in public data. The enhanced model achieved **1.07% MAPE** and **70.6% Directional Accuracy**, validating the efficacy of signature features for quarterly planning.

### High-Frequency Price Prediction [(Link)](https://github.com/tessella/High-frequency-price-movement-prediction)
Deep learning classifier for Limit Order Book (LOB) analysis. Engineered features from 4-level depth data (bid/ask volumes, imbalances) and compared FFNN vs. RNN architectures, achieving **71.29% validation accuracy** using TensorFlow/Keras.

### UK Gas Demand Forecasting I: XGBoost [(Link)](https://github.com/tessella/UK-Gas-Demand-Forecasting)
Gradient boosting regression model focused on domain-specific feature engineering. Developed a custom windchill index to better translate weather data into demand signals, achieving an **R² = 0.951**.

### Neural Networks from Scratch [(Link)](https://github.com/tessella/xor-problem-nn-c)
Feedforward neural network built entirely in **C** without ML libraries. Features manual memory management, ground-up implementation of gradient descent, and cost function optimization to demonstrate core ML fundamentals.
